# PPI-Network-Shortest-Path-Analysis
Title: PPI Network Analysis and Comparison via Shortest Path and Wilcoxon Test

Description: This Python script is designed to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. It creates networks from provided PPI files, calculates the shortest paths within these networks, and compares the shortest paths of two distinct networks using the Wilcoxon statistical test. The script is intended for those with a working knowledge of Python and interest in biological network analysis.

Key Features:

Network creation for PPI analysis.
Shortest path calculation in PPI networks.
Statistical comparison of two PPI networks using Wilcoxon test.
Prerequisites:

Python programming language.
Input files: main.py, Human-PPI.txt, protein-list1.txt, protein-list2.txt.
Recommended Python IDE: PyCharm PC 2021.3.2 (Community Edition).
Libraries Required:

pandas
networkx (version 2.8rc1)
numpy
thinkstats2 (along with thinkx library for additional support)
scipy
matplotlib
os
Installation:
The thinkx library needs to be separately downloaded to support thinkstats2.

Execution Notes:

All input files must be located in the same folder, labeled 'Assignment4'.
The script's execution, especially the shortest path length calculation for the first graph, may be time-intensive but will complete.
Execution Guide for PyCharm:

Open PyCharm.
Set the working directory to 'Assignment5'.
Mark the selected working directory as 'Assignment5' within PyCharm.
PyCharm will recognize the marked folder as the Source folder for the project.
All necessary files should be visible in the left side window of PyCharm.
Open main.py.
Execute the script by clicking the run button.
The script will proceed to run and yield the desired output.
